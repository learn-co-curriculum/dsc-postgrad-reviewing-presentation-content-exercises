# Project Presentation Content - Exercises

## Introduction

Before you work on your own materials, let's revisit the messy presentation materials to examine the impact of reviewing project content. This lesson is a quiz that will require you to review the presentation through the lens of refining the presentation content. Take time to think through the quiz questions before reviewing the answers in Part 2!

## Objectives

You will be able to:

- review content of an example presentation
- identify areas where the sample presentation could improve

## Answers


### Question 1

B and D

### Question 2

1. Audience: consumer of the analysis (end customer)
2. Background: Non-technical
3. How will they use it? Affect how they appraise how much their home will likely sell for
4. Short attention span
5. Goal: For them to buy access to your analysis

### Question 3

B

### Question 4

C

### Question 5

Presentation outline is missing:

- Hook: An introduction to the business context and the business problem
- Contact details: how an interested customer could reach you

### Question 6

We could remove:

- Data Preparation (#3)
- Modeling Process (#5)

Both are too technical and too detailed to be relevant to our target audience.

### Question 7

Data slide (#2) probably goes into too much detail - a brief overview of how the data is relevant to the problem is probably more appropriate.
